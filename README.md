### Objective
Our goal with this project is to design a video game in the Unity game engine with secure software engineering principles.

This involves architecture and design, code review, risk analysis, penetration testing, and feedback.

Our main objective is to secure the high scores aspect of the game to make it harder for attackers to modify their scores. This will involve all of the processes listed above.
